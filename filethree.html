Test goes here<br>
This is the third file<br>
<P>
<p id = "SectionTwo"> section two etc be sure to add another p tag with more text.a: a stands for Anchor, which means Link. This is the tag that makes it all happen.
href: Means Hypertext REFerence. The href part is another attribute, with the location of the other page as its value. Just change theotherpage.html to the name of the second file. Don’t forget the quotation marks!</p><br>
<p id = "SectionThree"> section three etc be sure to add another p tag with more text.Whatever you put inside the link tags will become a link, coloured blue and underlined. When you rest your mouse on it your cursor will turn into a hand and the URL of the page will appear in your browser’s status bar (at the bottom of the window). If you want to make links to other parts of your page (for example a link to the top of the page), set up some internal links. Changing the default colours of the links is dealt with in body attributes.</p><br>
